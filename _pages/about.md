I'm Bohan Zhang (aka baihuaDaDa), a second-year undergraduate student from [ACM Honor Class](https://acm.sjtu.edu.cn) at [Zhiyuan College](https://zhiyuan.sjtu.edu.cn), [Shanghai Jiao Tong University (SJTU)](https://www.sjtu.edu.cn). I am interested in computer science, especially in the fields of large language model and machine learning system. I am currently working at SJTU System Wisdom Lab (SysdomLab), mentored by Doc. [Chen Chen](https://chenc10.github.io), associate professor in [John Hopcroft Center for Computer Science](https://jhc.sjtu.edu.cn) at SJTU.

Projects

======

<!-- [Deep Cognition](), Contributor -->

[Mx Compiler](https://github.com/baihuaDaDa/Compiler-2024)

---
A Compiler from Mx language (which is a C++ & Java like language but simplified) to RV32I Assembly via LLVM-IR. Several optimizations have been implemented: Mem2Reg, Linear Scan Register Allocation, Global2Local, Function Inlining, Global Code Motion, Aggressive Dead Code Elimination.

[RISC-V_32 CPU](https://github.com/baihuaDaDa/RISC-V_CPU_Arch-2024)

---
A Tomasulo RISC-V CPU with iCache and branch predictor with 2-bit saturating counter. The architecture design can be successfully implemented on FPGA board.

[Distributed Hash Table](https://github.com/baihuaDaDa/DHT-2024)

---
Two distinct distributed hash table protocols are implemented in this project: Chord and Kademlia. Both protocols aim to provide efficient, scalable, and fault-tolerant systems for storing and retrieving (key, value) pairs across a distributed network of nodes.

Honors

======
**2023,2024** Zhiyuan Honors Scholarship
**2024** Undergraduate Merit Scholarship (B Class) of Shanghai Jiao Tong University
